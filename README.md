# FoodFamily

A multiplatform mobile app based solution to minimise food wastage in student university accommodations. Developed in flutter.

## Features

### Marketplace

Students can join the marketplace for their student accommodation. On this marketplace they can find close to expiry items listed by other students at alarmingly low prices.
If a student is willing to, they can view marketplaces from nearby accommodation using the map feature on the marketplace page.

When a student finds an item they like they can enquire, in which case the seller receives their enquiry request which they can choose to accept or reject. If accepted, they
can contact the enquirer, otherwise the next enquirer in the queue is displayed.

### My Kitchen

Students can invite each other to join their "kitchen". The kitchen is a place where students can put items they are willing to share with others, in order to inform them that
they are free to use it. This also stores the expiry of the item so that students can be reminded to use them. Once an item is apporaching expiry, students can directly add it to the marketplace from the kitchen. Screenshots of the application are found below.
